📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM & Artificial Rabbit Optimization (ARO)
🧠 1. Project Overview
This project predicts stock prices using a deep learning technique called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.
To optimize hyperparameters, a nature-inspired algorithm called Artificial Rabbit Optimization (ARO) is used.
A user-friendly GUI is built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload a CSV file and view the predicted stock data in real-time.

🚀 2. Project Features
🔹 Data Preprocessing
Clean and scale stock data for efficient model training.

🔹 LSTM Model
A deep neural network specially designed for time-series forecasting.

🔹 Artificial Rabbit Optimization (ARO)
An advanced algorithm used for hyperparameter tuning.

🔹 Streamlit GUI
Interactive interface to upload data and view predictions instantly.

🔹 Evaluation Metrics
Performance is measured using MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

🔹 Visualization
Graphs to compare actual vs. predicted stock prices.

⚙️ 4. Installation Guide
📌 Requirements: Python 3.7 or higher
✅ Recommended: Use a virtual environment

🔧 Steps:
bash
Copy
Edit
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate environment
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
📦 Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ 5. How to Run
Open Terminal/Command Prompt

Navigate to your project directory

Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
The app will open in your web browser

Upload your stock data CSV file

The model will:

Perform hyperparameter tuning

Train using LSTM

Show prediction results, evaluation metrics, and visual graphs

📊 6. CSV File Format Requirements
Your CSV file should contain the following columns:

Date (optional)

Close/Last (mandatory)

Volume, Open, High, Low (optional)

📁 Example Format:
mathematica
Copy
Edit
Date,Close/Last,Volume,Open,High,Low
2020-01-02,$296.24,33870100,296.24,300.60,295.19
💡 7. Notes & Tips
✅ Date column is ignored during training.
✅ Code automatically handles $ symbols and commas in the price.
✅ Hyperparameter tuning is set to 5 iterations by default – more iterations = better accuracy (but longer processing).
✅ You can customize LSTM and ARO parameters in models/lstm_model.py and optimization/aro_optimizer.py.
